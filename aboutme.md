My name is Branden Lopez and I am a student majoring in Financial Mathematics and Statistics at the 7th best university in the nation, University of California Santa Barbara. 

Transferring to UCSB in 2018, I came in as a Math Sciences major with a minor in Statistics. In the Summer of 2019 I took my first class in data analytics and fell in love. Since then I have joined my university's Data Science Club and have worked on numerous projects. To this day the most challenging project was building a model to detect when Tweets are advertising illicit drugs. 

Outside of academia I love spending time with my girlfriend, trying new reciepes, and bettering myself.
