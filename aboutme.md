title: About me
---

My name is Branden Lopez, I am a first generation Hispanic-American. This June I became the first person in family to earn a degree and from the 7th best public university in the nation, UC Santa Barbara. If I did not have a unquenching thirst for challenges, it is likely I would not be here today. Enduring homelessness, racism, homophobia, and a lack of mentorship in my academic career, but I overcame these obstacles constantly working low paying jobs to achieve a better future. Going beyond what was required I have created a Twitter detection model that would thwart Tweets selling illicit drugs to youth and adults alike. I have worked on other projects, but none as empowering as when I help others. 

When Iâ€™m not busy with school or work, I love to cook, read, play video games, and workout.
