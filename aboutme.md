title: About me
---

My name is Branden Lopez and I am a student majoring in Financial Mathematics and Statistics at the 7th best university in the nation, University of California Santa Barbara. 

Transferring to UCSB in 2018, I have explored various topics in Finacne and Mathematics. In the Spring of 2019, I participated in my firt data sceince competition and fell in love. Since then I have joined my university's Data Science Club and have worked on numerous projects. To this day the most challenging project was building a model to detect when Tweets are advertising illicit drugs. My goal right now is to become a Financial Data Analyst.

Outside of academia I love spending time with friends, trying new recipes, and bettering myself!
