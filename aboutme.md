title: About me
---

My name is Branden Lopez, I am a first generation Hispanic-American. This June I became the first person in family to earn a degree and from the 7th best public school in that nation, University of California Santa Barbara. There are many events that have defined who I am throughout my life: homelessness, racism, homophobia, and a lack of mentorship in my academic career. I overcame these obstacles and accepted suffering as a necessary act of our god, but we live in a different era, one were I can use my knowledge of data science and finance to help those around me. I have taken action already, working with a team of peers to create a Twitter detection filter that would thwart messages selling illicit drugs to youth and adults alike. I have worked on other projects, but none as empowering as when I help others. There is no length I will not go to better myself and those around me. 

Other than contributing to the community, I love to cook, read, play video games, and workout. Below are my favorite reciepe and book, reflecting two things I love to do. Share meals over a good story. 

- Favoirte recipe: [Vegan Curry](https://www.theendlessmeal.com/creamy-coconut-lentil-curry/)

- Favorite book: [Surely You're Joking, Mr.Feynman!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!)
