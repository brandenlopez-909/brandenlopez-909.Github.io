title: About me
---

My name is Branden Lopez, I am a first generation Hispanic-American and this June I became the first person in family to earn a degree. If I did not have a unquenching thirst for challenges, it is likely I would not be here today. Enduring homelessness, racism, homophobia, and a lack of mentorship in my academic career, I have overcome and will contnue to progress.

When Iâ€™m not busy with school or work, I love to cook, read, play video games, and workout.
